### Problem Statement 

As the Super Store Inc. expands its business by opening more branches across the country, the Company anticipates that continued reliance to Excel files for managing product sales data would lead to data discrepancies, inconsistencies, and mismanagement. To address these issues and improve management and scalability of the data, the decision has been made to centralize the product sales information under a SQL database. This project will also leverage the centralized data to develop an Excel Dashboard to provide real-time insights and enhancements to the company’s data analytical capabilities. 

### Detailed Process 

*1. Data Collection and Migration*
  *	**Collecting Data:** Gathered multiple Excel files containing Super Store Inc.’s product sales data.
  * **Migration to SQL:** Transferred the collected data into a MS SQL Server database to enhance data security and integrity through normalization, the implementation of unique key constraints, and the application of user logins for controlled access.

*2. Database Setup*
  * **Schema Design:** Designed a relational database schema tailored to the structure and requirements of the data.
  * **SQL Integration:** Developed and executed SQL queries to create and adjust tables and relationships, ensuring efficient integration and organization of multiple SQL tables.

*3. Dashboard Development*
  * **Connection to Database:** Linked Excel to the MS SQL Server database to enable dynamic data retrieval.
  * **Interactive Dashboard Creation:** Developed an interactive dashboard within Excel to visualize and analyze the company’s product sales performance and trends, utilizing charts, graphs, and summary statistics to provide actionable insights.

### Skills and Tools Used
